### LST.AI - Meet the deep learning-based successor to LST. 

There are two ways of using and setting up LST.AI.

If you prefer to work in python, please clone the repository and init the code base:

```
pip3 install .
```

If you prefer to use LST.AI in a dockerized application, we provide a Dockerfile.
