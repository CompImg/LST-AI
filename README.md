Ideen fÃ¼r Simultaneous Image Synthesis and SegmentatIon:
--------------------------------------------------------
> Use [attention loss](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35557607/) for synthesis? => Does the segmentation mask come from the gt or network?

> How to weigh the loss terms (Dice/BCE vs. SSIM)?

> Include dropout?

> Have the discriminator also look at the segmentation?

> "W-Net" architecture -> First synthesize DIR, then segment it? Shared weights?
